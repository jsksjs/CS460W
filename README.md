This is my CS460W semester long project. I was in a group of 3, though not much work was added by the others even though I put much effort into allowing them to participate every chance available.

In the original private GitLab repo, there were a many branches created for different features like drawing, translation, layers, bitmap testing, selection, toolbars, and even the drawing canvas.
These branches were merged into master when they were completed.

This project was only worked on for about half a semester and the amount of time we had was taken into account so many choices had to be made regarding performance and overall usability.

I opted for C# and WPF because even though it was the wrong choice for raw performance, it was the best choice for groupwork. It was easier for me to explain and walkthough C# than to choose something more fitting for an image editor like C++/Python and Qt and be the only one who understood the code.
